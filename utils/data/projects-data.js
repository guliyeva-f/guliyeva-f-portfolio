        description: "I developed a simplified clone of the Libraff.az bookstore website. The project features a JSON Server–based REST API where all book data is stored and rendered on the frontend. Users can browse books, filter them by categories, view detailed information, and manage a shopping cart by adding or removing items. The platform also includes an admin panel that allows administrators to add, edit, or delete books. This project demonstrates a clean UI, functional filtering, dynamic rendering, and basic full CRUD operations using JSON Server",

The site includes basic interactive features such as a loan calculator, a deposit calculator, sliders, a search section, and dropdown menus. All actions work on the client side without a backend or API. The goal of the project was to repeat the main design and make the basic functions work smoothly",

Users can click any country to open a separate details page that displays more information. There is also a “random country” card that shows a different country each time. Users can filter countries by region, view more countries with the “show more” button, and see important details like population, capital, languages, and more.
